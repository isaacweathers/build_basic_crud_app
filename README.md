# build_basic_crud_app
In this workshop you will create a CRUD API that Creates, Reads, Updates and Deletes items from a DynamoDB table. The API will run serverless, so there is no management of the underlying infrastructure and scaling is done automatically. You will learn how easy it is to create an API on AWS, all within 45 minutes.
